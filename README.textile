h1. About tux.it

"tux.it":http://tux.it is an open source url shortener (with a bunch of ideas for the future).

The goal of the project is to collect funds for the Linux Foundation (or another one which supports Open-Source philsophy) and give to "Tux":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux , our favourite penguin, the deserved fame.
